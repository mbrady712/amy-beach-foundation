	b. Henniker, NH, Sept. 5, 1867; d. New York, Dec. 27, 1944</p>

	<p>Known as the first female composer to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra (her “Gaelic” Symphony, premiered by the Boston 
	Symphony Orchestra in 1896), she was also one of the first U.S. composers to have her music be recognized in Europe, and THE first 
	classical U.S. composer to achieve success without the benefit of European study.</p>

	<p>A remarkable child prodigy, she made her public debut as a pianist in 1883, also the year of her first published compositions.  
	In 1885 she performed with the Boston  Symphony, but upon her marriage to the distinguished surgeon, Dr. H.H.A. Beach, she curtailed 
	her performing in accordance with his wishes, and focused on composition.  She made one performance per year, with the proceeds donated 
	to charity, and one of these performances was of her own piano concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1900.  Following the death 
	of her husband in 1910, she resumed performing, and toured Europe to great acclaim, performing  her own music, until the onset of WWI.</p>

	<p>Other works include her Mass in E-flat, Op. 5 (performed by the Handel and Haydn society in 1892), a Violin Sonata, Op.  34 (1896), 
	a Piano Quintet, Op. 67 (1907), Theme and Variations for Flute and String Quartet, Op. 80 (1916), a String Quartet, Op. 89 (1929), 
	the opera Cabildo, Op. 149 (1932), a Piano Trio, Op. 150 (1938), a wide range of choral music both sacred and secular, many songs, 
	and a vast amount of music for piano (ranging from works for children to large pieces of the highest virtuosity).</p>

	<p>Later in life she spent most summers composing at the MacDowell Colony, and the rest of the year based mostly in New York City and 
	her Cape Cod home in Centerville, Massachusetts.  At her death she left more than 300 published works, and more of her music has been 
	published in recent decades.  She declared the MacDowell Colony as her estate executor, and all earnings from her music aid in the 
	operations and continuation of the Colony.</p>

<!--The final project builds on several previous assignments. Create a website that displays:

a CSS styled, horizontal menu with hover effects at the top.
a styled HTML table
a styled HTML form that collects all the information from the previous assignment.
a styled <footer> with copyright information
This project is all about CSS style, and making the elements on your page look fantastic using CSS. Since you already have the HTML code needed from previous assignments you can spend most of your time on the style of the page.

Make this website about something you genuinely care about, and place a link to this website on your Webtrain portfolio page in the Portfolio projects section. You are beginning to build out your portfolio.

Be creative - for example, if your site is about State Parks that you love, use the HTML table to display lists of parks with their different features...-->
