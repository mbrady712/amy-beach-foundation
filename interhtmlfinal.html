<!--The final project builds on several previous assignments. Create a website that displays:

a CSS styled, horizontal menu with hover effects at the top.
a styled HTML table
a styled HTML form that collects all the information from the previous assignment.
a styled <footer> with copyright information
This project is all about CSS style, and making the elements on your page look fantastic using CSS. 
Since you already have the HTML code needed from previous assignments you can spend most of your time on the style of the page.

Make this website about something you genuinely care about, and place a link to this website on your 
Webtrain portfolio page in the Portfolio projects section. You are beginning to build out your portfolio.

Be creative - for example, if your site is about State Parks that you love, use the HTML table to 
display lists of parks with their different features...-->
